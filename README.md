# Dipole Moment of Migrating Charges

Dipole moment of a migrating system of classical charges. Set up a system of particles' initial and final positions. Then calculate the system's dipole moment change. The code contains a classical simulation of a defect's (vacancy) migration with (Mulliken) charges obtained from DFT simulations of MgO.
